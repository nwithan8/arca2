An extendable Discord bot

This was a basic proof-of-concept. However, shortly after finishing this, I realized it's basically re-inventing the wheel that is [Red](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/).

As a result, I will not be moving forward with this, and instead defer to Red for a Discord bot framework.
